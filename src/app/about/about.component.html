      <p>HiðŸ™‹! I am currently a master student in University of Twente and KTH Royal Institute of Technology studying a double degree program EIT Digital Master School in Human-Computer Interaction and Design. My background in software engineering and diverse interest in phychology, design, art, etc. allowed me to be capable of carrying out user-centered design for novel digital services. </p>
      <p>Besides, speaking both Chinese and English, the variety of language fasinates me. I would also like to explore in AI more specifically natural language processing to put what Iâ€™ve learned into practice.</p>
      <p>Curious and passionate, I am always ready to create something amazing and fulfilll real societal needs!</p>
